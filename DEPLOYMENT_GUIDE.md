🛑 STOPLIST - THE ANTI-TODO LIST APP

Unlike traditional todo apps that focus on what you *should* do, StopList helps you track and avoid bad habits by reminding you what you *shouldn't* do.

🎯 WHY STOPLIST?

Psychology shows that stopping bad habits is often more impactful than adding good ones. StopList is built around this principle - helping you break free from negative patterns.

✨ KEY FEATURES

• 🛑 Stop-Items List - Manage things you want to stop doing
• 🔔 Smart Reminders - Daily, weekly, or monthly notifications
• ⏰ Custom Scheduling - Set exact times to remind yourself
• 👆 Swipe to Delete - Intuitive gesture controls
• ✅ Track Progress - Strikethrough completed items
• 🌙 Dark Theme - Easy on the eyes
• 💪 Motivational Quotes - Built-in encouragement
• 📊 Quick Suggestions - Common bad habits to stop

🔥 PERFECT FOR STOPPING:

• Checking social media first thing in the morning
• Eating late at night
• Procrastinating important tasks
• Negative self-talk
• Hitting snooze
• Excessive phone usage
• Unhealthy habits

🎨 BEAUTIFUL DESIGN

• Modern dark theme (Deep Navy + Coral)
• Smooth animations
• Bottom-aligned input for easy thumb access
• Clean, distraction-free interface

🔒 PRIVACY & DATA

• Your data stays on your device
• No account required
• No data collection beyond analytics
• Firebase Analytics for app improvement only

💡 HOW IT WORKS

1. Add items you want to stop doing
2. Set reminders for when you're most tempted
3. Get notifications: "Remember: DON'T [your item]"
4. Mark items complete when you successfully avoid them
5. Build better habits by focusing on what NOT to do

🚀 THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND IT

Research shows that:
- Negative reinforcement can be more effective than positive
- Being mindful of what to avoid improves self-control
- Regular reminders help break automatic behaviors
- Visual tracking increases accountability
