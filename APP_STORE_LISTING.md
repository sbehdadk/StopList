## 📋 Description

### Full Description (Both Stores)

**Forget what you should do. Remember what you SHOULDN'T.**

StopList is the first app designed specifically for tracking things you need to STOP doing. Not tasks to complete—habits to break, mistakes to avoid, and boundaries to maintain.

**🎯 PERFECT FOR:**
• Breaking bad habits (stop smoking, stop procrastinating)
• Avoiding common mistakes (don't forget keys, don't leave oven on)
• Setting personal boundaries (don't check work email after 8pm)
• Maintaining discipline (don't eat junk food, don't skip workouts)
• Preventing relapse (don't text your ex, don't visit toxic websites)

**✨ FEATURES:**
• ⛔ Simple, minimalist interface focused on what NOT to do
• 🔔 Smart reminders so you don't forget your "don'ts"
• ✓ Check off items you successfully avoided
• 👆 Swipe to delete completed stop-items
• 🌙 Beautiful dark theme that's easy on your eyes
• 💾 All data saved locally—your privacy matters

**💪 WHY STOPLIST?**
Traditional to-do lists focus on productivity. StopList focuses on wellbeing.

Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is STOP:
- Stop endless scrolling
- Stop saying yes to everything
- Stop negative self-talk
- Stop unhealthy habits
- Stop toxic patterns

**🧠 BACKED BY PSYCHOLOGY:**
Research shows that explicitly stating what NOT to do is more effective for behavior change than just listing positive goals. StopList makes this principle easy to apply in daily life.

**🔒 PRIVACY FIRST:**
Your data stays on your device. No accounts, no tracking, no data collection. Just you and your stop-list.

**🎁 100% FREE:**
Download now and start breaking bad habits today!
