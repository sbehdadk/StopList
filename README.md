### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install
# OR: npm install

# Start development server
make start
# OR: npx expo start
```

### Using Make Commands

This project uses `Makefile` for easy development and deployment. Run `make help` to see all available commands.

```bash
# See all available commands
make help
```

---

## 📋 Makefile Commands Reference

### Development

```bash
make install       # Install all project dependencies
make start         # Start Expo dev server (scan QR with Expo Go app)
make android       # Run on connected Android device/emulator
make ios           # Run on connected iOS device/simulator
make test          # Run test suite
make status        # Show project status and recent builds
```

### Version Management

Automated version bumping - updates `app.json` with new version and build numbers:

```bash
make version-patch  # Bug fixes: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
make version-minor  # New features: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
make version-major  # Breaking changes: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
```

After bumping, the script shows:
- Updated version number
- New Android versionCode
- New iOS buildNumber  
- Git commands to commit and tag

### Building

```bash
make build-dev      # Development APK (includes debugging, test ads)
                    # Use this to test on real device with ads working

make build-preview  # Preview APK (production-like, easier to share)
                    # Use for final testing before store submission

make build-prod     # Production AAB (for Google Play Store)
                    # This is what you submit to Google Play
```

**Note**: All builds take ~15-20 minutes. Download link provided when complete.

### Deployment

```bash
make submit         # Submit to Google Play Store
                    # (requires production build first)

make update         # Push OTA update to existing users
                    # Updates JavaScript instantly, no review needed
                    # Use for bug fixes and minor changes
```

### Maintenance

```bash
make clean          # Clean build cache and reinstall dependencies
                    # Use if encountering build issues
```

## 🎯 What Makes This Unique?

Unlike traditional to-do lists that focus on tasks to complete, StopList helps you:
- ✅ Break bad habits
- ✅ Set personal boundaries  
- ✅ Avoid common mistakes
- ✅ Maintain discipline
- ✅ Prevent relapse

**Market Gap**: While there are thousands of to-do apps, there's no popular app specifically for "stop-doing" lists.

---

## 💰 Monetization

**Revenue Model**: Free app with ads (AdMob)
- Banner ads (bottom of screen)
- Interstitial ads (every 5 user actions)
- Strategic, non-intrusive placement

**Projected Revenue** (Conservative):
- Month 3: $50-150
- Month 6: $300-800  
- Month 12: $2,000-5,000

See [MONETIZATION_GUIDE.md](MONETIZATION_GUIDE.md) for complete strategy.
